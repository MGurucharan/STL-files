NUMBER OF SET BITS ALGORITHM STL

int num=7;
int count = __builtin_popcount();

7 is 111 in binary , since each int takes 4 bytes , so 32 bits 00000000000......111,
the above popcount method returns the number of set bits i.e 1s , so count is 3.

6 is 110 , then count =2

long long num=112321312312;
int count=__builtin_popcountll(); 

this is for long numbers;
